# CDS-experiment-2
Aim:To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types) an storage class.<br>

Theory:<br>
In C++, data types have specific sizes which determine how much memory is allocated for each type. For example, an int typically uses 4 bytes, char uses 1 byte, float uses 4 bytes, and double uses 8 bytes. Sizes can vary based on the system and compiler.<br>

Storage classes define the scope, visibility, and lifetime of variables/functions. <br> The four storage classes are:<br>

auto: Default for local variables.<br>
static: Retains value between function calls, local to the file if used in global context.<br>
extern: Extends visibility across multiple files.<br>
register: Suggests storing variable in a CPU register for faster access, though modern compilers often ignore this.<br>
These classes help manage how and where data is stored and accessed within a program.<br>
Code for the program:<br>
Size of Datatypes:<br>

Conclusion:- in this experiment we learnt to check the size of data types and made program using storage class
